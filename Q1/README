to avoid deadlock, if the philosopher posiion is even we pick up the left fork first and the the right fork, if its odd then we pick up the right fork first and then the left fork 

In part(a) 1:
    without using semephores we use spin locks to avoid entring the critical section if  one of the fork is occupied 
In part(a) 2:
    using semphores we replace the while loop with sem_wait and after we are done with the CS we use sem_post to release the semophore
