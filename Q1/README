to avoid deadlock, if the philosopher position is 0 1 2 3 them pick up the left fork first and then the right fork if the position is 4 then pickup the right fork first and the left fork;

In part(a) 1:
    without using semephores we use spin locks to avoid entring the critical section if  one of the fork is occupied 
In part(a) 2:
    using semphores we replace the while loop with sem_wait and after we are done with the CS we use sem_post to release the semophore
in part(b):
    if we accuire the bowl after we accique the forks and the keep the bowl first and them the forks , we will always avoid deadlock
